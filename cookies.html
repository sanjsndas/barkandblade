                        Cookies are small data files that websites place on your computer or mobile device when you visit them. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. Cookies enable the website to "remember" your actions or preferences over a period of time, so you don't have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. They are essentially a unique identifier for your browser or device, allowing for a more personalized and efficient browsing experience.

                        First-party cookies are those set directly by the Bark & Blade website (barkandblade.com). These cookies are essential for core website functionality and are often used to remember your preferences, maintain your login session, or track items in your shopping cart. Because they are set by the domain you are visiting, they are generally considered more secure and less privacy-invasive than third-party cookies. Our first-party cookies are crucial for ensuring a smooth and personalized user experience as you navigate our platform and interact with its features.

These are typically used for cross-site tracking, advertising, or embedding content from external services (e.g., YouTube videos, social media buttons). On Bark & Blade, third-party cookies may be set by our analytics providers, advertising partners, or social media platforms.

They track whether users click on our ads and then perform a desired action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter.

This allows us to collect data on how these segments interact with the variations to determine which performs best.

                        Upon your first visit to our website, you will be presented with a cookie consent banner that provides information about the types of cookies we use and allows you to manage your preferences. You can choose to accept all cookies, customize your settings, or reject non-essential cookies. This mechanism ensures that we obtain your informed consent for cookie usage, particularly for those not strictly necessary for website functionality.

                        Most web browsers allow you to manage your cookie preferences through their settings. You can typically configure your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the option to accept or decline it. You can also delete existing cookies or set your browser to automatically reject all cookies. Please note that disabling certain cookies, especially essential ones, may affect the functionality and usability of our Website.

                        Some web browsers may transmit "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals to websites. Currently, there is no universally accepted standard for how websites should respond to these signals. Bark & Blade does not currently respond to DNT signals. However, you can manage your cookie preferences directly through our cookie consent banner or your browser settings as described in this policy. We are monitoring developments in DNT standards and may update our practices in the future.

                        In addition to cookies, Bark & Blade may use other similar technologies like web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs). These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages or in emails. They help us determine which emails have been opened by recipients and allow us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns.

                        Bark & Blade may also use HTML5 Local Storage, a technology that allows websites to store data directly in the browser. Unlike cookies, Local Storage can store significantly more data and is not automatically sent with every HTTP request. We might use Local Storage to save user preferences, such as your progress in a tutorial series, or to cache certain website elements for faster loading times. This data remains on your device until you clear your browser's local storage.

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        The duration for which a cookie remains on your device depends on whether it is a "session" cookie or a "persistent" cookie. Session cookies expire when you stop browsing. Persistent cookies remain until they expire or are deleted. The expiration period for persistent cookies varies, from a few minutes to several years, depending on their purpose. For example, a cookie remembering your login might last for a few days, while an analytics cookie might persist for a year to track returning visitors.

                        When you make a choice regarding our cookie consent banner (accept or decline), we set a specific cookie to remember your preference. This ensures that you are not prompted with the banner on every subsequent visit for a defined period. This "consent cookie" is essential for respecting your choice and providing a consistent user experience. It typically stores a simple "accepted" or "declined" value and has a specific expiration date, after which you might be prompted again to reconfirm your preferences.

                        While cookies themselves are small text files and do not directly contain personal data like your name or email address, they can store unique identifiers that, when combined with other information, could potentially be linked to an individual. For example, a cookie might store a user ID that is then linked to your personal data on our servers. We handle any information collected via cookies in accordance with our comprehensive Privacy Policy, ensuring your data is protected and used responsibly.

                        Some third-party advertising partners may place cookies on your device to track your browsing activity across different websites and build a profile of your interests. This enables them to show you personalized advertisements that are more relevant to you. These cookies are often used for retargeting purposes, showing you ads for products or services you've previously viewed.

                        An example of an authentication cookie is one that stores a unique session ID after you log in. This ID allows our server to recognize you as an authenticated user as you move between pages, preventing you from having to re-enter your password for every action. This cookie is typically a session cookie, meaning it expires when you close your browser, ensuring that your session is securely terminated. It is fundamental for maintaining your logged-in state and accessing member-only areas.

                        A common example of a shopping cart cookie is one that stores a unique identifier for your cart. This cookie allows The Artisan Shop to remember the items you've added to your cart even if you navigate away from the shop section or browse other parts of the website. It ensures that your selections persist until you complete your purchase or manually clear your cart. This is typically a persistent cookie, allowing you to return to your cart later.

                        An advertising personalization cookie might be set by a third-party ad network after you view certain products in The Artisan Shop. This cookie then allows that ad network to show you advertisements for similar wood carving tools or materials on other websites you visit. This is a targeting cookie designed to make advertising more relevant to your interests, and its use is contingent on your explicit consent through our cookie banner.

This might include a dedicated "Cookie Settings" link in the footer or a section within your "My Workshop Dashboard."

                        The use of cookies significantly enhances your overall user experience on Bark & Blade. They enable features like remembering your login, personalizing content recommendations, and streamlining your shopping cart process.

                        Bark & Blade implements security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the information stored in cookies. This includes using secure HTTP (HTTPS) for all website traffic, which encrypts data exchanged between your browser and our servers. While cookies themselves are not executable programs and cannot carry viruses, we ensure that our cookie management practices align with industry best practices to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of cookie data, contributing to the overall security of your online experience.

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Much of the data collected through cookies, particularly performance and analytics cookies, is aggregated. This means that individual user data is combined with data from many other users to create statistical summaries. This aggregated data does not identify any individual user and is used to understand broad trends, such as popular content categories or peak traffic times. This allows us to make data-driven decisions about website improvements without compromising individual user privacy.

                        In addition to aggregation, we employ anonymization techniques for certain cookie-derived data. Anonymization involves removing or altering personal identifiers so that the data can no longer be linked to an individual. For example, IP addresses collected via analytics cookies might be truncated or hashed. This ensures that even if the data were to be accessed, it could not be used to identify you personally, further enhancing your privacy while still providing valuable insights for website optimization.

                        To enhance transparency, Bark & Blade categorizes its cookies into distinct groups (e.g., Essential, Performance, Functionality, Advertising). This categorization helps you understand the specific purpose of each cookie type and make informed decisions about your consent. Our cookie consent banner and this policy provide detailed explanations for each category, ensuring that you have a clear picture of how different cookies contribute to your experience on our Website.

                        While general instructions for managing cookies are provided, specific steps may vary depending on your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Each browser has its own settings menu where you can view, delete, and configure cookie preferences. We recommend consulting the official support documentation for your specific browser for the most accurate and up-to-date instructions on managing cookies effectively.

                        For certain third-party advertising and analytics cookies, you may have additional opt-out options provided directly by the third-party providers themselves. Industry initiatives like the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) also offer tools to opt out of interest-based advertising from participating companies. While our consent banner provides a primary control, these external mechanisms offer additional avenues for managing your preferences for third-party tracking.

While this document focuses specifically on cookies and similar technologies, the overarching principles of data collection, use, and protection outlined in our Privacy Policy apply to all information gathered, including that obtained through cookies.

                        You have the right to withdraw your consent for non-essential cookies at any time. This can typically be done by revisiting our cookie consent settings (if available as a persistent link on the site) or by adjusting your browser's cookie settings. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. However, it may impact the functionality of certain website features or the personalization of your experience. We respect your autonomy in managing your cookie preferences.

                        Your cookie consent, once given, is typically valid for a specific period (e.g., 12 months) as determined by applicable regulations or our internal policies. After this period, or if there are significant changes to our cookie practices, you may be prompted again to reconfirm your cookie preferences. This ensures that your consent remains current and informed, and that you have regular opportunities to review and adjust your choices regarding our use of cookies.

                        (Note: A full, dynamic cookie table is beyond the scope of a static HTML page, but conceptually, we would provide one.) In a more advanced implementation, Bark & Blade would provide a detailed cookie table listing all specific cookies used, their provider, purpose, and expiration date. This table would be dynamically updated to reflect any changes. The goal is to offer granular transparency, allowing users to see exactly which cookies are set and what information they are used for, empowering truly informed consent.

                        Examples of cookie-based personalization include: remembering your recently viewed items in The Artisan Shop, suggesting tutorials based on your skill level (e.g., if you frequently view "Beginner" patterns), or displaying community posts from topics you've previously engaged with. These tailored experiences aim to make your time on Bark & Blade more efficient and relevant, ensuring you discover content and products that genuinely interest you, fostering a deeper connection with the wood carving community.

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Some third-party advertising and analytics services may use cookies in conjunction with other identifiers to attempt cross-device tracking. This means they might try to link your activity across different devices (e.g., phone, tablet, desktop) to build a more comprehensive profile of your interests. While Bark & Blade itself does not engage in this, if you consent to third-party advertising cookies, this may occur. You can manage these preferences through your browser settings or specific third-party opt-out tools.

                        When you open emails from Bark & Blade, we may use tiny pixel tags (similar to cookies) embedded in the email to track whether the email was opened and which links were clicked. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns and understand what content is most engaging to our subscribers. This data is typically aggregated and used to improve our communication strategies, ensuring we send you relevant and valuable information about wood carving.

                        When we conduct A/B tests, cookies are used to ensure that you consistently see the same version of a feature throughout your visit. For example, if you are part of a group seeing "Version A" of a new homepage layout, a cookie ensures you continue to see Version A, allowing us to accurately measure its performance against "Version B." This helps us gather reliable data to make informed decisions about website design and functionality improvements.

                        Some cookies are used for load balancing purposes. These cookies help distribute website traffic across multiple servers, ensuring that the website remains fast and responsive even during peak usage times. They ensure you are directed to the most efficient server, optimizing your connection and preventing service interruptions. These are typically essential cookies, as they are crucial for maintaining the stability and availability of the Bark & Blade platform.

                        Cookies contribute to our fraud detection and prevention efforts. By analyzing patterns in cookie usage and associated data, we can identify unusual activities or suspicious behaviors that may indicate fraudulent attempts, such as unauthorized account access or payment fraud. This helps us protect both our users and our platform from malicious activities, ensuring a secure environment for all transactions and interactions within Bark & Blade.

                        Cookies can be used to segment users into different groups based on their behavior or preferences (e.g., beginners, advanced carvers, shoppers). This segmentation allows us to deliver more targeted content, promotions, or features to specific user groups. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized for analysis, helping us understand the diverse needs of our community and tailor our offerings more effectively without identifying individuals.

                        Retargeting cookies are a type of advertising cookie that allows us to show you ads for products or services you've previously shown interest in on Bark & Blade, even after you've left our site. For example, if you viewed a specific carving knife, you might see an ad for that knife on another website. This helps remind you of items you considered and encourages you to return to complete a purchase. This is done with your consent for advertising cookies.

                        If Bark & Blade operates an affiliate program, cookies are used to track referrals from our affiliate partners. When you click on an affiliate link and then make a purchase on our Website, a cookie helps attribute that sale to the correct affiliate. This allows us to compensate our partners accurately. This data is primarily used for business and marketing attribution and does not personally identify you to the affiliate.

                        Cookies may store non-precise geographic location information (e.g., country or region based on your IP address). This allows Bark & Blade to display localized content, currency, or shipping options relevant to your general area. This information is typically used to enhance your browsing experience by providing region-specific information and does not pinpoint your exact location.

                        Cookies can be used to control the display of user feedback surveys. For example, a cookie might ensure that you are only prompted to complete a survey once, or that you are not shown the same survey repeatedly within a certain timeframe. This helps us gather valuable feedback from a diverse range of users without overwhelming any single individual, ensuring a balanced and representative collection of opinions for website improvement.
