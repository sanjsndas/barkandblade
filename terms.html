                        If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.

This ensures that even if one part of the agreement is found to be legally unsound, the rest of the Terms remain binding and effective, maintaining the overall integrity of the agreement between you and Bark & Blade.

                        Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Bark & Blade Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Bark & Blade, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court.

You further agree that you may bring claims against us only on your own behalf and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
