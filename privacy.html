                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Bark & Blade adheres to the principle of data minimization, meaning we only collect personal information that is directly relevant, adequate, and necessary for the specified purposes outlined in this policy. We avoid collecting excessive amounts of data or information that is not essential for providing our services, improving your experience, or fulfilling legal obligations. This commitment ensures that your privacy is respected by limiting the scope of data we process, thereby reducing potential risks associated with data handling. Our internal processes are designed to regularly review and prune unnecessary data, maintaining a lean and efficient data footprint.

                        Where possible and appropriate, we anonymize or aggregate personal information so that it can no longer be linked to you. This anonymized and aggregated data is then used for various purposes, including statistical analysis, research, and improving our services without compromising individual privacy. For instance, we might analyze aggregated data on popular wood species or workshop attendance trends to refine our content offerings. This method allows us to derive valuable insights and enhance our platform's functionality while ensuring that your identifiable information remains protected and separate from such analytical datasets.
